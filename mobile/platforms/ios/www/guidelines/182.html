 Etiology
</h3>
<p>
 Several organisms can cause infectious urethritis. The presence of Gram-negative intracellular diplococci (GNID) on urethral smear is indicative of gonorrhea infection, which is frequently accompanied by chlamydial infection. Nongonoccocal urethritis (NGU), which is diagnosed when examination findings or microscopy indicate inflammation without GNID, is caused by
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 in 15%&ndash;40% of cases; however, prevalence varies by age group, with a lower burden of disease occurring among older men (244). Complications of NGU among males infected with
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 include epididymitis and Reiter&rsquo;s syndrome. Documentation of chlamydial infection is essential because of the need for partner referral for evaluation and treatment.
</p>
<p>
 In most cases of nonchlamydial NGU, no pathogen can be detected.
 <i>
  M. genitalium
 </i>
 , which appears to be sexually transmitted, is associated with both symptoms of urethritis and urethral inflammation and accounts for 15%&ndash;25% of NGU cases in the United States (240&ndash;243).
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 , HSV, and adenovirus also can cause NGU, but data supporting other
 <i>
  Mycoplasma
 </i>
 species and
 <i>
  Ureaplasma
 </i>
 as etiologic agents are inconsistent (244&ndash;247). Diagnostic and treatment procedures for these organisms are reserved for situations in which these infections are suspected (e.g., contact with trichomoniasis, genital lesions, or severe dysuria and meatitis, which might suggest genital herpes) or when NGU is not responsive to therapy. Enteric bacteria have been identified as an uncommon cause of NGU and might be associated with insertive anal intercourse (244).
