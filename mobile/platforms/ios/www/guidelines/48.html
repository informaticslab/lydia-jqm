 Chancroid
</h2>
<p>
 The prevalence of chancroid has declined in the United States (93). When infection does occur, it is usually associated with sporadic outbreaks. Worldwide, chancroid appears to have declined as well, although infection might still occur in some regions of Africa and the Caribbean. Chancroid, as well as genital herpes and syphilis, is a risk factor in the transmission of HIV infection (144).
</p>
<p>
 A definitive diagnosis of chancroid requires the identification of
 <i>
  H. ducreyi
 </i>
 on special culture media that is not widely available from commercial sources; even when these media are used, sensitivity is &lt;80% (145). No FDA-cleared PCR test for
 <i>
  H. ducreyi
 </i>
 is available in the United States, but such testing can be performed by clinical laboratories that have developed their own PCR test and have conducted a CLIA verification study.
</p>
<p>
 The combination of a painful genital ulcer and tender suppurative inguinal adenopathy suggests the diagnosis of chancroid (146). A probable diagnosis of chancroid, for both clinical and surveillance purposes, can be made if all of the following criteria are met: 1) the patient has one or more painful genital ulcers; 2) the patient has no evidence of T. pallidum infection by darkfield examination of ulcer exudate or by a serologic test for syphilis performed at least 7 days after onset of ulcers; 3) the clinical presentation, appearance of genital ulcers and, if present, regional lymphadenopathy are typical for chancroid; and 4) a test for HSV performed on the ulcer exudate is negative.
