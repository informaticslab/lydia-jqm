 HPV Tests
</h2>
<p>
 HPV tests are available for clinical use and are recommended&nbsp;for the triage of women aged &ge;21 years who have abnormal Pap test results (ASC-US). Additionally, these tests can be used in conjunction with a Pap test (adjunct testing) for cervical cancer screening of women aged &ge;30 years. These tests should not be used for women aged &lt;20 years for screening or management of abnormal Pap tests or for STD screening. Current FDA-approved HPV tests detect viral nucleic acid (DNA). Several FDA-approved tests for high-risk HPV testing are available for use in the United States. The Hybrid Capture 2 High-Risk HPV DNA test (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, Maryland) and the Cervista HPV High-Risk test (Hologics, Beford, Massachusetts) detect any of 13&ndash;14 high-risk HPV types, whereas the Cervista HPV 16/18 test detects type-specific infection with HPV types 16 and 18. The Digene HC2 HPV DNA test (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, Maryland) detects any of 13 high-risk or five low-risk HPV types, although use of this test is not indicated in the STD clinic setting (i.e., only high-risk HPV DNA testing is necessary) (423).
</p>
<p>
 High-risk HPV DNA tests are recommended for the triage of women aged &ge;21 years who have ASC-US cytology results. In addition, these tests are recommended for routine adjunctive testing (along with cervical cytology) used to screen women aged &ge;30 years (424).
</p>
<p>
 HPV DNA testing (including HR HPV and HPV 16/18 tests) is not recommended for the following situations (425&ndash;427):
</p>
<p>
 &bull; deciding whether to vaccinate for HPV;
</p>
<p>
 &bull; conducting STD screening for HPV;
</p>
<p>
 &bull; triaging LSIL;
</p>
<p>
 &bull; testing adolescents aged &lt;21 years; and
</p>
<p>
 &bull; screening for primary cervical cancer as a stand-alone test (i.e., without a Pap test).
</p>
<p>
 Women might benefit from receiving printed information about the value of and indication for cervical cancer screening (i.e., Pap testing), and they should be provided a clinic visit report that states whether a Pap test was obtained during the clinic visit. When available, a copy of the Pap test result should be provided. Women with abnormal screening or diagnostic tests should be referred to clinic settings that employ providers who are experienced in managing these cases (see Follow-Up). Cervical screening programs should screen women who have received HPV vaccination in the same manner as unvaccinated women.
