 Follow-Up
</h3>
<p>
 Because of the high rate of reinfection among patients in whom trichomoniasis was diagnosed (17% were reinfected within 3 months in one study), rescreening for
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 at 3 months following initial infection can be considered for sexually active women with trichomoniasis; the benefit of this approach, however, has not been fully evaluated (64). No data support rescreening in men diagnosed with
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 . While most recurrent
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 infections are thought to result from having sex with an untreated partner (i.e., reinfection), some&nbsp;recurrent cases can be attributed to diminished susceptibility to metronidazole. Low-level metronidazole resistance has been identified in 2%&ndash;5% of cases of vaginal trichomoniasis (362,363), but high-level resistance only rarely occurs. Fortunately, infections caused by most of these organisms respond to tinidazole or higher doses of metronidazole. Tinidazole has a longer serum half-life and reaches higher levels in genitourinary tissues than metronidazole. In addition, many
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 isolates have lower minimal lethal concentrations (MLCs) to tinidazole than metronidazole.
</p>
<p>
 If treatment failure occurs with metronidazole 2-g single dose and reinfection is excluded, the patient can be treated with metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days. For patients failing this regimen, treatment with tinidazole or metronidazole at 2 g orally for 5 days should be considered. If these therapies are not effective, further management should be discussed with a specialist. The consultation should ideally include determination of the susceptibility of
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 to metronidazole and tinidazole. Consultation and
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 susceptibility testing is available from CDC (telephone: 404-718-4141; website:
