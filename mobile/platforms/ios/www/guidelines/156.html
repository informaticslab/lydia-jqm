 Congenital Syphilis
</h2>
<p>
 Effective prevention and detection of congenital syphilis depends on the identification of syphilis in pregnant women and, therefore, on the routine serologic screening of pregnant women during the first prenatal visit. In communities and populations in which the risk for congenital syphilis is high, serologic testing and a sexual history also should be obtained at 28 weeks&rsquo; gestation and at delivery. Moreover, as part of the management of pregnant women who have syphilis, information concerning the treatment of sex partners should be obtained to assess the risk for reinfection.
</p>
<p>
 Routine screening of newborn sera or umbilical cord blood is not recommended. Serologic testing of the mother&rsquo;s serum is preferred rather than testing of the infant&rsquo;s serum because the serologic tests performed on infant serum can be nonreactive if the mother&rsquo;s serologic test result is of low titer or the mother was infected late in pregnancy (see Diagnostic Considerations and Use of Serologic Tests). Screening can be performed using either a nontreponemal or treponemal test. If either screening test is positive, testing must be performed immediately using the other complimentary test (i.e., nontreponemal test followed by treponemal test or vice-versa). No infant or mother should leave the hospital unless maternal serologic status has been documented at least once during pregnancy; in communities and populations in which the risk for congenital syphilis is high, documentation should also occur at delivery.
