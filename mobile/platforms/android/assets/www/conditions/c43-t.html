 Crusted Scabies
</h3>
<p>
 Crusted scabies (i.e., Norwegian scabies) is an aggressive&nbsp;infestation that usually occurs in immunodeficient, debilitated, or malnourished persons (476). Patients who are receiving systemic or potent topical glucocorticoids, organ transplant recipients, mentally retarded or physically incapacitated&nbsp;persons, HIV-infected or human T-lymphotrophic virus-1-infected persons, and persons with various hematologic&nbsp;malignancies are at risk for developing crusted scabies. Crusted scabies is associated with greater transmissibility than scabies. No controlled therapeutic studies for crusted scabies have been conducted, and the appropriate treatment remains&nbsp;unclear. Substantial risk for treatment failure might exist with a single topical scabicide or with oral ivermectin treatment. Combined treatment with a topical scabicide and repeated treatment with oral ivermectin 200 &mu;g/kg on days 1, 2, 8, 9, and 15 are suggested. Additional treatment on days 22 and 29 might be required for severe cases. Ivermectin should be combined with the application of either 5% topical benzyl benzoate or 5% topical permethrin (full body application to be repeated daily for 7 days then 2 times weekly until release from care or cure). Lindane should be avoided because of the risks for neurotoxicity associated with both heavy applications and denuded skin. Fingernails should be closely trimmed to reduce injury from excessive scratching.
