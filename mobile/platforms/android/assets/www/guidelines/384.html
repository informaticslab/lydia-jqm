 Scabies
</h2>
<p>
 The predominant symptom of scabies is pruritus, but sensitization to
 <i>
  Sarcoptes scabiei
 </i>
 occurs before pruritus begins. The first time a person is infested with
 <i>
  S. scabiei
 </i>
 , sensitization can take several weeks to develop. However, pruritus might occur within 24 hours after a subsequent reinfestation. Scabies in adults frequently is sexually acquired, although scabies in children usually is not.

<p>
 Lindane is not recommended as first-line therapy because of toxicity (471). It should only be used as an alternative if the patient cannot tolerate other therapies or if other therapies have failed.
</p>
<p>
 Lindane should not be used immediately after a bath or shower, and it should not be used by persons who have extensive dermatitis, women who are pregnant or lactating, or children aged &lt;2 years. Lindane resistance has been reported in some areas of the world, including parts of the United States (474). Seizures have occurred when lindane was applied after a bath or used by patients who had extensive dermatitis. Aplastic anemia after lindane use also has been reported (471, 474).
</p>
<p>
 Permethrin is effective and safe and less expensive than ivermectin (471, 474). One study demonstrated increased mortality among elderly, debilitated persons who received ivermectin, but this observation has not been confirmed in subsequent studies (475).
