 HIV Infection
</h4>
<p>
 There is increasing evidence for epidemiologic and biologic&nbsp;interaction between HIV and
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 (370&ndash;375).
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 infection in HIV-infected women might enhance HIV transmission by increasing genital shedding of the virus (376,377), and treatment for
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 has been shown to reduce HIV shedding (376,377). For sexually active women who are HIV-positive, screening for trichomoniasis at entry into care with subsequent screening performed at least annually is recommended based on the reported prevalence of
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 ,&nbsp;the effect of treatment at reducing vaginal HIV shedding, and the potential complications of upper-genital-tract infections&nbsp;among women who are left untreated (130,370&ndash;375). Rescreening 3 months after completion of therapy should be considered among HIV-positive women with trichomoniasis, a recommendation based on the high proportion of recurrent or persistent infection and the association between HIV and
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 infection (64,374,378).
</p>
<p>
 A recent randomized clinical trial involving women coinfected&nbsp;with trichomoniasis and HIV demonstrated that a single dose of metronidazole 2 gm orally was not as effective as 500 mg twice daily for 7 days (379). Therefore, a multi-dose treatment regimen for
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 can be considered in HIV-infected women.
