 Treatment
</h3>
<p>
 Several antimicrobial regimens have been effective, but only a limited number of controlled trials have been published (192). Treatment has been shown to halt progression of lesions, and healing typically proceeds inward from the ulcer margins; prolonged therapy is usually required to permit granulation&nbsp;and reepithelialization of the ulcers. Relapse can occur 6&ndash;18 months after apparently effective therapy.
</p>
<p>
 The addition of an aminoglycoside (e.g., gentamicin 1 mg/kg IV every 8 hours) to these regimens can be consid- ered if improvement is not evident within the first few days of therapy.
