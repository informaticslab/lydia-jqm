 Postvaccination Testing for Serologic Response
</h4>
<p>
 Serologic testing for immunity is not necessary after routine vaccination of adolescents or adults. However, such testing is recommended for persons whose subsequent clinical management&nbsp;depends on knowledge of their immune status (e.g., health-care workers or public safety workers at high risk for continued percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood or body fluids). In addition, postvaccination testing is recommended for 1) HIV-infected persons and other immunocompromised persons to determine the need for revaccination and the type of follow-up testing and 2) sex and needle-sharing partners of HBsAg-positive persons to determine the need for revaccination&nbsp;and for other methods to protect themselves from HBV infection.
</p>
<p>
 If indicated, testing should be performed 1&ndash;2 months after administration of the last dose of the vaccine series by using a method that allows determination of a protective level of anti-HBs (i.e., &ge;10 mIU/mL). Persons determined to have anti-HBs levels of &lt;10 mIU/mL after the primary vaccine series should be revaccinated with a 3-dose series and provided with anti-HBs testing 1&ndash;2 months after the third dose. Persons who do not respond to revaccination should be tested for HBsAg. If HBsAg positive, the person should receive appropriate management (see Management of HBsAg-Positive Persons); if HBsAg negative, the person should be considered susceptible to HBV infection and counseled concerning precautions to prevent HBV infection and the need for HBIG PEP for any known exposure (see Postexposure Prophylaxis).
