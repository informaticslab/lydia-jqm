 HIV Infection
</h5>
<p>
 Evidence is insufficient to determine whether infants who have congenital syphilis and whose mothers are coinfected with HIV require different evaluation, therapy, or follow-up for syphilis than is recommended for all infants.
</p>
<p>
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 &para; The absence of a fourfold or greater titer for an infant does not exclude congenital syphilis.
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 ** CSF test results obtained during the neonatal period can be difficult to interpret; normal values differ by gestational age and are higher in preterm infants. Values as high as 25 white blood cells (WBCs)/mm3 and/or protein of 150 mg/dL might occur among normal neonates; some specialists, however, recommend that lower values (i.e., 5 WBCs/mm3 and protein of 40 mg/dL) be considered the upper limits of normal. Other causes of elevated values should be considered when an infant is being evaluated for congenital syphilis.
</p>
<p>
 &dagger;&dagger; A woman treated with a regimen other than those recommended in these guidelines for treatment should be considered untreated.
</p>
<p>
 &sect;&sect; If the infant&rsquo;s nontreponemal test is nonreactive and the provider determines that the mother&rsquo;s risk for untreated syphilis is low, treatment of the infant (single IM dose of benzathine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg for possible incubating syphilis) without an evaluation can be considered.
