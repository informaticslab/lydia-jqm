 Pregnancy
</h4>
<p>
 Vaginal trichomoniasis has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly premature rupture of membranes, preterm delivery, and low birth weight. However,&nbsp;metronidazole treatment has not been shown to reduce perinatal&nbsp;morbidity. Although some trials suggest the possibility of increased prematurity or low birth weight after metronidazole treatment, limitations of the studies prevent definitive conclusions&nbsp;regarding risks for treatment (367,368). Treatment of
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 might relieve symptoms of vaginal discharge in pregnant women and might prevent respiratory or genital infection of the newborn and further sexual transmission. Clinicians should counsel patients regarding the potential risks and benefits of treatment and communicate the option of therapy deferral in asymptomatic pregnant women until after 37 weeks&rsquo; gestation. All symptomatic pregnant women should not only be considered for treatment regardless of pregnancy stage, but be provided careful counseling regarding condom use and the continued risk of sexual transmission.
</p>
<p>
 Women can be treated with 2 g metronidazole in a single dose at any stage of pregnancy. Multiple studies and meta-analyses have not demonstrated an association between metronidazole use during pregnancy and teratogenic or mutagenic effects in infants (342,343,369). The safety of tinidazole in pregnant women, however, has not been well evaluated.
</p>
<p>
 In lactating women who are administered metronidazole, withholding breastfeeding during treatment and for 12&ndash;24 hours after the last dose will reduce the exposure of the infant to metronidazole. For women treated with tinidazole, interruption&nbsp;of breastfeeding is recommended during treatment and for 3 days after the last dose.
