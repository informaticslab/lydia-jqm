<p>
 Patients should be informed that the rash and pruritus of scabies might persist for up to 2 weeks after treatment. Symptoms or signs that persist for &gt;2 weeks can be attributed to several factors. Treatment failure can be caused by resistance to medication, although faulty application of topical scabicides also can contribute to persistence &mdash; patients with crusted scabies might have poor penetration into thick scaly skin and harbor mites in these difficult-to-penetrate layers. Particular attention must be given to the fingernails of these patients. Reinfection from family members or fomites can occur in the absence of appropriate contact treatment and washing of bedding and clothing. Even when treatment is successful and reinfection is avoided, symptoms can persist or worsen as a result of allergic dermatitis. Finally, the presence of household mites can cause symptoms to persist as a result of cross reactivity&nbsp;between antigens. Retreatment can be considered after 1&ndash;2 weeks for patients who are still symptomatic or if live mites are present. Treatment with an alternative regimen is recommended&nbsp;for persons who do not respond to the recommended treatment.
