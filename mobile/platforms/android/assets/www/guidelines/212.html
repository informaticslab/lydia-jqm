 Diagnostic Considerations
</h4>
<p>
 Sensitive and specific methods used to diagnose chlamydial ophthalmia in the neonate include both tissue culture and nonculture tests (e.g., direct fluorescence antibody [DFA] tests, EIA, and NAAT). Most nonculture tests are not FDA-cleared for the detection of chlamydia from conjunctival swabs, and clinical laboratories must verify the procedure according to CLIA regulations. Specimens for culture isolation and nonculture tests should be obtained from the everted eyelid using a dacron-tipped swab or the swab specified by the manufacturer&rsquo;s test kit, and they must contain conjunctival cells, not exudate alone. Specific diagnosis of
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 infection confirms the need for treatment not only for the neonate, but also for the mother and her sex partner(s). Ocular specimens from infants being evaluated for chlamydial conjunctivitis also should be tested for
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 .

                <p class="regimen_footer_text">* An association between oral erythromycin and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHIS) has been reported in infants aged <6 weeks who were treated with this drug. Infants treated with erythromycin should be followed for signs and symptoms of IHPS.</p>
            <hr/>
                <p class="regimen_footer_text">† Data on use of other macrolides (e.g., azithromycin and clarithromycin) for the treatment of neonatal chlamydia infection are limited. The results of one study involving a limited number of patients suggest that a short course of azithromycin, 20 mg/kg/day orally, 1 dose daily for 3 days, might be effective (292).</p>
        </div>
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 Topical antibiotic therapy alone is inadequate for treatment of chlamydial infection and is unnecessary when systemic treatment is administered.
