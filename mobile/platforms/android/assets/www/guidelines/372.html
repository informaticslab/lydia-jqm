 Proctitis, Proctocolitis, and Enteritis
</h1>
<p>
 Sexually transmitted gastrointestinal syndromes include proctitis, proctocolitis, and enteritis. Evaluation for these syndromes&nbsp;should include appropriate diagnostic procedures (e.g., anoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, stool examination, and culture).
</p>
<p>
 Proctitis is inflammation of the rectum (i.e., the distal&nbsp;10&ndash;12 cm) that can be associated with anorectal pain, tenesmus, or rectal discharge.
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 ,
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 (including LGV serovars),
 <i>
  T. pallidum
 </i>
 , and HSV are the most common sexually transmitted pathogens involved. In patients coinfected with HIV, herpes proctitis can be especially severe. Proctitis occurs predominantly among persons who participate in receptive anal intercourse.
</p>
<p>
 Proctocolitis is associated with symptoms of proctitis, diarrhea or abdominal cramps, and inflammation of the colonic mucosa extending to 12 cm above the anus. Fecal leukocytes might be detected on stool examination, depending on the pathogen. Pathogenic organisms include
 <i>
  Campylobacter
 </i>
 sp.,
 <i>
  Shigella
 </i>
 sp.,
 <i>
  Entamoeba histolytica
 </i>
 , and LGV serovars of
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 . CMV or other opportunistic agents can be involved in immunosuppressed HIV-infected patients. &nbsp;Proctocolitis can be acquired by the oral route or by oral-anal contact, depending on the pathogen.
</p>
<p>
 Enteritis usually results in diarrhea and abdominal cramping&nbsp;without signs of proctitis or proctocolitis; it occurs among persons whose sexual practices include oral-anal contact. In otherwise healthy persons,
 <i>
  Giardia
 </i>
 <i>
  lamblia
 </i>
 is most frequently implicated. When outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness occur among social or sexual networks of MSM, clinicians should consider sexual transmission as a mode of spread and provide counseling accordingly. Among HIV-infected patients, gastrointestinal&nbsp;illness can be caused by other infections that usually are not sexually transmitted, including CMV,
 <i>
  Mycobacterium avium
 </i>
 &ndash;
 <i>
  intracellulare
 </i>
 ,
 <i>
  Salmonella
 </i>
 sp.,
 <i>
  Campylobacter
 </i>
 sp.,
 <i>
  Shigella
 </i>
 sp.,
 <i>
  Cryptosporidium
 </i>
 ,
 <i>
  Microsporidium
 </i>
 , and
 <i>
  Isospora
 </i>
 . Multiple stool examinations might be necessary to detect
 <i>
  Giardia
 </i>
 , and special stool preparations are required to diagnose cryptosporidiosis&nbsp;and microsporidiosis. In addition, enteritis can be directly caused by HIV infection.
</p>
<p>
 When laboratory diagnostic capabilities are available, treatment decisions should be based on the specific diagnosis. Diagnostic and treatment recommendations for all enteric infections are beyond the scope of these guidelines.
