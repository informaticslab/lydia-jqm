 Bacterial Vaginosis
</h2>
<p>
 BV is a polymicrobial clinical syndrome resulting from replacement of the normal hydrogen peroxide producing Lactobacillus sp. in the vagina with high concentrations of anaerobic bacteria (e.g.,
 <i>
  Prevotella
 </i>
 sp. and
 <i>
  Mobiluncus
 </i>
 sp.),
 <i>
  G. vaginalis
 </i>
 ,
 <i>
  Ureaplasma
 </i>
 ,
 <i>
  Mycoplasma
 </i>
 , and numerous fastidious or uncultivated anaerobes. Some women experience transient vaginal microbial changes, whereas others experience them for a longer intervals of time. Among women presenting for care, BV is the most prevalent cause of vaginal discharge or malodor; however, in a nationally representative survey, most women with BV were asymptomatic (318).
</p>
<p>
 BV is associated with having multiple male or female partners, a new sex partner, douching, lack of condom use, and lack of vaginal lactobacilli; women who have never been sexually active can also be affected. The cause of the microbial alteration that characterizes BV is not fully understood, nor is whether BV results from acquisition of a sexually transmitted pathogen. Nonetheless, women with BV are at increased risk for the acquisition of some STDs (e.g., HIV,
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 ,
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 , and HSV- 2), complications after gynecologic surgery, complications of pregnancy, and recurrence of BV. Treatment of male sex partners has not been beneficial in preventing the recurrence of BV.
