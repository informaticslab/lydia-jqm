 Intrauterine Contraceptive Devices
</h3>
<p>
 IUDs are popular contraceptive choices for women. Both levonorgestrel and copper-containing devices are marketed in the United States. The risk for PID associated with IUD use is primarily confined to the first 3 weeks after insertion and is uncommon thereafter (400,401). Given the popularity of IUDs, practitioners might encounter PID in IUD users. Evidence is insufficient to recommend that the removal of IUDs in women diagnosed with acute PID. However, caution should be exercised if the IUD remains in place, and close clinical follow-up is mandatory. The rate of treatment failure and recurrent PID in women continuing to use an IUD is unknown, and no data have been collected regarding treatment outcomes by type of IUD (e.g., copper or levonorgestrel).
