 Postexposure Prophylaxis
</h4>
<p>
 Persons who recently have been exposed to HAV and who previously have not received hepatitis A vaccine should be administered a single dose of single-antigen vaccine or IG (0.02 mL/kg) as soon as possible. Information about the relative efficacy of vaccine compared with IG postexposure is limited, and no data are available for persons aged &gt;40 years or those with underlying medical conditions. Therefore, decisions&nbsp;to use vaccine or IG should take into account patient characteristics associated with more severe manifestations of hepatitis A, including older age and CLD.
</p>
<p>
 For healthy persons aged 12 months to 40 years, single-antigen hepatitis A vaccine at the age-appropriate dose is preferred over IG because of vaccine advantages, including long-term protection and ease of administration. For persons aged &gt;40 years, IG is preferred because of the absence of information&nbsp;regarding vaccine performance and the more severe manifestations of hepatitis A in this age group; vaccine can be used if IG cannot be obtained. The magnitude of the risk for HAV transmission from the exposure should be considered in decisions to use IG or vaccine. IG should be used for children aged &lt;12 months, immunocompromised persons, persons who have had diagnosed CLD, and persons for whom vaccine is contraindicated.
</p>
<p>
 If IG is administered to persons for whom hepatitis A vaccine&nbsp;also is recommended, a dose of vaccine should be provided simultaneously with IG. The second vaccine dose should be administered according to the licensed schedule to complete the series. The efficacy of IG or vaccine when administered &gt;2 weeks after exposure has not been established (438).
