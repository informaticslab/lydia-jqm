 Granuloma Inguinale (Donovanosis)
</h2>
<p>
 Granuloma inguinale is a genital ulcerative disease caused by the intracellular gram-negative bacterium
 <i>
  Klebsiella granulomatis
 </i>
 (formerly known as
 <i>
  Calymmatobacterium granulomatis
 </i>
 ). The disease occurs rarely in the United States, although it is endemic in some tropical and developing areas, including India; Papua, New Guinea; the Caribbean; central Australia; and southern Africa (192,193). Clinically, the disease is commonly characterized as painless, slowly progressive ulcerative lesions on the genitals or perineum without regional lymphadenopathy; subcutaneous granulomas (pseudoboboes) might also occur. The lesions are highly vascular (i.e., beefy red appearance) and bleed easily on contact. The clinical presentation also can include hypertrophic, necrotic, or sclerotic variants. Extragenital infection can occur with extension of infection to the pelvis, or it can disseminate to intraabdominal organs, bones, or the mouth. The lesions also can develop secondary bacterial infection and can coexist with other sexually transmitted pathogens.

<p>
 The causative organism is difficult to culture, and diagnosis requires visualization of dark-staining Donovan bodies on tissue crush preparation or biopsy. No FDA-cleared molecular tests for the detection of
 <i>
  K. granulomatis
 </i>
 DNA exist, but such an assay might be useful when undertaken by laboratories that have conducted a CLIA verification study.
