 Treatment for Proctitis
</h2>
<p>
 Acute proctitis of recent onset among persons who have recently practiced receptive anal intercourse is usually sexually&nbsp;acquired (469,470). Such patients should be examined by anoscopy and should be evaluated for infection with HSV,
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 ,
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 , and
 <i>
  T. pallidum
 </i>
 . If an anorectal exudate is detected on examination or if polymorphonuclear leukocytes are detected on a Gram-stained smear of anorectal secretions, the following therapy should be prescribed while awaiting additional laboratory tests.

</p>
<p>
 Patients with suspected or documented herpes proctitis should be managed in the same manner as those with genital herpes (see Genital HSV Infections). If painful perianal ulcers are present or mucosal ulcers are detected on anoscopy, presumptive&nbsp;therapy should include a regimen for genital herpes and LGV. Appropriate diagnostic testing for LGV should be conducted in accordance with state or federal guidelines, and doxycycline therapy should be administered 100 mg orally twice daily for 3 weeks.
</p>
<p>
 For MSM, treatment for LGV proctitis/proctocolitis with 3 weeks of doxycycline in those with anorectal chlamydia and either 1) proctitis (as detected by proctoscopic examination and the presence of &gt;10 white-blood cells upon high-power field examination of an anorectal smear specimen) or 2) HIV infection can be considered.
