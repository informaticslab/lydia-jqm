 Cervical Cancer Screening for Women Who Attend STD Clinics or Have a History of STDs
</h1>
<p>
 Women attending STD clinics for the treatment of genital&nbsp;infection with high-risk types of Human Papillomavirus (HR-HPV) might be at increased risk for cervical cancer; persistence of HR-HPV can cause cervical cancer and its precancerous lesions. One study demonstrated an HR-HPV prevalence of 27% among women receiving treatment in an STD clinic setting; prevalence was highest among persons aged 14&ndash;19 and decreased with increasing age (418). In an evaluation&nbsp;of women attending STD clinics, over half of women were at increased risk for cervical cancer as a result of HPV infection, cervical disease, or history of cervical disease compared with women without these characteristics (419).

<p>
 Cervical cytology (i.e., a Pap test) is an effective, low-cost screening test for preventing invasive cervical cancer. In a 2004 survey, 49% of all STD clinics in the United States reported providing cervical screening services, and 20% reported use of HPV DNA testing (419).
</p>
<p>
 Current guidelines from USPSTF and ACOG recommend that cervical screening begin at age 21 years (96,97). This recommendation&nbsp;is based on the low incidence of cervical cancer and limited utility of screening in younger women (98). ACS recommends that women start cervical screening with Pap tests after 3 years of initiating sexual activity but by no later than age 21 years (98). Recommended screening intervals (

 ) should continue through 65 years according to USPSTF (
