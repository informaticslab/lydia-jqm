 HIV Infection
</h4>
<p>
 The incidence of VVC in HIV-infected women is unknown. Vaginal
 <i>
  Candida
 </i>
 colonization rates among HIV-infected women are higher than among those for seronegative women with similar demographic characteristics and high-risk behaviors,&nbsp;and the colonization rates correlate with increasing severity of immunosuppression. Symptomatic VVC is more frequent in seropositive women and similarly correlates with severity of immunodeficiency. In addition, among HIV-infected women, systemic azole exposure is associated with the isolation of nonalbicans
 <i>
  Candida
 </i>
 species from the vagina.
</p>
<p>
 On the basis of available data, therapy for VVC in HIV-infected women should not differ from that for seronegative women. Although long-term prophylactic therapy with fluconazole at a dose of 200 mg weekly has been effective in reducing
 <i>
  C. albicans
 </i>
 colonization and symptomatic VVC (381), this regimen is not recommended for routine primary prophylaxis in HIV-infected women in the absence of recurrent VVC (129). Given the frequency at which RVVC occurs in the immmunocompetent healthy population, the occurrence of RVVC should not be considered an indication for HIV testing&nbsp;among women previously testing HIV negative. Although VVC is associated with increased HIV seroconversion in HIV-negative women and increased HIV cervicovaginal levels in HIV-positive women, the effect of treatment for VVC on HIV acquisition and transmission remains unknown.
