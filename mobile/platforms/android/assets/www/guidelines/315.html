 Management of Sex Partners
</h2>
<p>
 Patients who have acute epididymitis that is confirmed or suspected to be caused by
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 or
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 should be instructed to refer sex partners for evaluation and treatment if their contact with the index patient was within the 60 days preceding onset of their own symptoms. &nbsp;Patients should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse&nbsp;until they and their sex partners have been adequately treated (i.e., until therapy is completed and patient and partners no longer have symptoms).
