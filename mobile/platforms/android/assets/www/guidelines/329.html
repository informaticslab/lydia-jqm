 HIV Infection
</h3>
<p>
 Persons who are HIV-infected are more likely to develop genital warts then persons who are not HIV-infected (413); moreover, lesions are more recalcitrant to treatment due to depressed cell-mediated immunity. No data suggest that treatment&nbsp;modalities for external genital warts should be different for HIV-infected persons. However, persons who are immunosuppressed&nbsp;because of HIV or other reasons might have larger or more numerous warts, might not respond as well as immunocompetent&nbsp;persons to therapy for genital warts, and might have more frequent recurrences after treatment (414&ndash;416). Squamous cell carcinomas arising in or resembling genital warts might occur more frequently among immunosuppressed persons, therefore requiring biopsy for confirmation of diagnosis for suspicious cases. Because of the increased incidence of anal cancer in HIV-infected MSM, screening for anal intraepithelial neoplasia by cytology can be considered (417). However, evidence is limited concerning the natural history of anal intraepithelial neoplasias, the reliability of screening methods, the safety and response to treatments, and the programmatic considerations that would support this screening approach.
