 Recommended Evaluation
</h5>
<p>
 &bull; CSF analysis for VDRL, cell count, and protein&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
 &bull; CBC, differential, and platelet count&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Long-bone radiographs&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
 A complete evaluation is not necessary if 10 days of parenteral therapy is administered, although such evaluations might be useful. For instance, a lumbar puncture might document CSF abnormalities that would prompt close follow-up. Other tests (e.g., CBC, platelet count, and bone radiographs) can be performed to further support a diagnosis of congenital syphilis. If a single dose of benzathine penicillin G is used, then the infant must be fully evaluated (i.e., by CSF examination, long-bone radiographs, and CBC with platelets), the full evaluation must be normal, and follow-up must be certain. If any part of the infant&rsquo;s evaluation is abnormal or not performed or if the CSF analysis is rendered uninterpretable because of contamination with blood, then a 10-day course of penicillin is required.&sect;&sect;
