 Follow-Up
</h2>
<p>
 Patients should demonstrate substantial clinical improvement&nbsp;(e.g., defervescence; reduction in direct or rebound abdominal tenderness; and reduction in uterine, adnexal, and cervical motion tenderness) within 3 days after initiation of therapy. Patients who do not improve within this period usually&nbsp;require hospitalization, additional diagnostic tests, and surgical intervention.
</p>
<p>
 If no clinical improvement has occurred within 72 hours after outpatient oral or parenteral therapy, further assessment&nbsp;should be performed. Subsequent hospitalization and an assessment of the antimicrobial regimen and diagnostics (including the consideration of diagnostic laparoscopy for alternative diagnoses) are recommended in women without clinical improvement. Women with documented chlamydial or gonococcal infections have a high rate of reinfection within&nbsp;6 months of treatment. Repeat testing of all women who have been diagnosed with chlamydia or gonorrhea is recommended 3&ndash;6 months after treatment, regardless of whether their sex partners were treated (267). All women diagnosed with acute PID should be offered HIV testing.
