 Diagnostic Considerations
</h3>
<p>
 BV can be diagnosed by the use of clinical criteria (i.e., Amsel&rsquo;s Diagnostic Criteria) (319) or Gram stain. A Gram stain (considered the gold standard laboratory method for diagnosing BV) is used to determine the relative concentration of lactobacilli (i.e., long Gram-positive rods), Gram-negative and Gram-variable rods and cocci (i.e.,
 <i>
  G. vaginalis
 </i>
 ,
 <i>
  Prevotella
 </i>
 ,
 <i>
  Porphyromonas
 </i>
 , and peptostreptococci), and curved Gram-negative rods (i.e.,
 <i>
  Mobiluncus
 </i>
 ) characteristic of BV. If a Gram&nbsp;stain is not available, clinical criteria can be used and require three of the following symptoms or signs:
</p>
<p>
 &bull; homogeneous, thin, white discharge that smoothly coats the vaginal walls;
</p>
<p>
 &bull; presence of clue cells on microscopic examination;
</p>
<p>
 &bull; pH of vaginal fluid &gt;4.5; or
</p>
<p>
 &bull; a fishy odor of vaginal discharge before or after addition of 10% KOH (i.e., the whiff test).
</p>
<p>
 Detection of three of these criteria has been correlated with results by Gram stain (320). Other tests, including a DNA probe-based test for high concentrations of
 <i>
  G. vaginalis
 </i>
 (Affirm VP III, Becton Dickinson, Sparks, Maryland), a prolineaminopeptidase test card (Pip Activity TestCard, Quidel, San Diego, California), and the OSOM BVBlue test have acceptable performance characteristics compared with Gram stain. Although a card test is available for the detection of elevated pH and trimethylamine, it has low sensitivity and specificity and therefore is not recommended. PCR also has been used in research settings for the detection of a variety of organisms associated with BV, but evaluation of its clinical utility is uncertain. Detection of one organism or group of organisms might be predictive of BV by Gram stain (321). However, additional evaluations are needed to confirm these associations. Culture of
 <i>
  G. vaginalis
 </i>
 is not recommended as a diagnostic tool because it is not specific. Cervical Pap tests have no clinical utility for the diagnosis of BV because of their low sensitivity.
