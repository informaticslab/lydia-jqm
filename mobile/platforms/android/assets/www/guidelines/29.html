 Screening Recommendations
</h3>
<p>
 Routine laboratory screening for common STDs is indicated for sexually active adolescents. The following screening recommendations summarize published federal agency and medical professional organizations&rsquo; clinical guidelines for sexually active adolescents:
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Routine screening for
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 of all sexually active females aged &le;25 years is recommended annually (81). Evidence is insufficient to recommend routine screening for
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 in sexually active young men based on feasibility, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness. However, screening of sexually active young men should be considered in clinical settings associated with high prevalence of chlamydia (e.g., adolescent clinics, correctional facilities, and STD clinics) (81,94).
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Routine screening for
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 in all sexually active women at risk for infection is recommended annually (82). Women aged &lt;25 years are at highest risk for gonorrhea infection. Other risk factors that place women at increased risk include a previous gonorrhea infection, the presence of other STDs, new or multiple sex partners, inconsistent condom use, commercial sex work, and drug use.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; HIV screening should be discussed with all adolescents and encouraged for those who are sexually active and those who use injection drugs (77,95).
</p>
<p>
 &bull;&nbsp;The routine screening of adolescents who are asymptomatic for certain STDs (e.g., syphilis, trichomoniasis, BV, HSV, HPV, HAV, and HBV) is not recommended. However, YMSM and pregnant adolescent females might require more thorough evaluation.
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Guidelines from USPSTF and ACOG recommend that cervical cancer screening begin at age 21 years (96,97), a recommendation based on the low incidence of cervical cancer and limited utility of screening for younger adolescents (98). However, the American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that women start cervical screening with Pap tests 3 years after initiating sexual activity, but by no later than age 21 years (99).
