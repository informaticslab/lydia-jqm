 Vulvovaginal Candidiasis
</h2>
<p>
 VVC usually is caused by
 <i>
  C. albicans
 </i>
 , but occasionally is caused by other
 <i>
  Candida
 </i>
 sp. or yeasts. Typical symptoms of VVC include pruritus, vaginal soreness, dyspareunia, external dysuria, and abnormal vaginal discharge. None of these symptoms&nbsp;is specific for VVC. An estimated 75% of women will have at least one episode of VVC, and 40%&ndash;45% will have two or more episodes within their lifetime. On the basis of clinical presentation, microbiology, host factors, and response to therapy, VVC can be classified as either uncomplicated or complicated (Box 3). Approximately 10%&ndash;20% of women will have complicated VVC that necessitates diagnostic and therapeutic considerations.
