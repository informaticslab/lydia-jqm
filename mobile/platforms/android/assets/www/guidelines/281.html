 Diagnostic Considerations
</h4>
<p>
 A diagnosis of
 <i>
  Candida
 </i>
 vaginitis is suggested clinically by the presence of external dysuria and vulvar pruritus, pain, swelling, and redness. Signs include vulvar edema, fissures, excoriations, or thick, curdy vaginal discharge. The diagnosis can be made in a woman who has signs and symptoms of vaginitis when either 1) a wet preparation (saline, 10% KOH) or Gram stain of vaginal discharge demonstrates yeasts, hyphae, or pseudohyphae&nbsp;or 2) a culture or other test yields a yeast species.
 <i>
  Candida
 </i>
 vaginitis is associated with a normal vaginal pH (&lt;4.5), and therefore, pH testing is not a useful diagnostic tool. Use of 10% KOH in wet preparations improves the visualization of yeast and mycelia by disrupting cellular material that might obscure the yeast or pseudohyphae. Examination of a wet mount with KOH preparation should be performed for all women with symptoms or signs of VVC, and women with a positive result should receive treatment. For women with negative wet mounts who are symptomatic, vaginal cultures for
 <i>
  Candida
 </i>
 should be considered. If the wet mount is negative and
 <i>
  Candida
 </i>
 cultures cannot be done, empiric treatment can be considered for symptomatic women with any sign of VVC on examination. Identifying
 <i>
  Candida
 </i>
 by culture in the absence of symptoms or signs is not an indication for treatment, because approximately 10%&ndash;20% of women harbor
 <i>
  Candida
 </i>
 sp. and other yeasts in the vagina. VVC can occur concomitantly with STDs. Most healthy women with uncomplicated VVC have no identifiable precipitating factors.
