 Diagnosis
</h3>
<p>
 Because cervicitis might be a sign of upper-genital&ndash;tract infection (endometritis), women who seek medical treatment for a new episode of cervicitis should be assessed for signs of PID and should be tested for
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 and for
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 with the most sensitive and specific test available. Women with cervicitis also should be evaluated for the presence of BV and trichomoniasis, and if these organisms are detected, they should be treated. Because the sensitivity of microscopy to detect
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 is relatively low (approximately 50%), symptomatic women with cervicitis and negative microscopy for trichomonads should receive further testing (i.e., culture or other FDA-cleared method). Although HSV-2 infection has been associated with cervicitis, the utility of specific testing (i.e., culture or serologic testing) for HSV-2 in this setting is unknown. Standardized diagnostic tests for
 <i>
  M. genitalium
 </i>
 are not commercially available.
</p>
<p>
 As discussed, NAAT should be used for diagnosing
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 in women with cervicitis; this testing can be performed on either vaginal, cervical, or urine samples (197). A finding of &gt;10 WBC in vaginal fluid, in the absence of trichomoniasis, might indicate endocervical inflammation caused specifically by
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 or
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 (264,265).

 Treatment
</h3>
<p>
 Several factors should affect the decision to provide presumptive therapy for cervicitis or to await the results of diagnostic tests. Treatment with antibiotics for
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 should be provided for those women at increased risk for this common STD (e.g., those aged &le;25 years, those with new or multiple sex partners, and those who engage in unprotected sex), especially if follow-up cannot be ensured and if a relatively insensitive diagnostic test is used in place of NAAT. Concurrent therapy for
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 is indicated if the prevalence of this infection is &gt;5% (those in younger age groups and those living in certain facilities).
</p>
<p>
 Trichomoniasis and BV should also be treated if detected. For women in whom any component of (or all) presumptive therapy is deferred, the results of sensitive tests for
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 (e.g., NAATs) should determine the need for treatment subsequent to the initial evaluation.
