 Initial Examination
</h4>
<p>
 An initial examination might include the following procedures:
</p>
<p>
 &bull; NAATs for
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 . These tests are preferred for the diagnostic evaluation of sexual assault victims, regardless of the sites of penetration or attempted penetration (197).
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Wet mount and culture or point-of-care testing of a vaginal-swab specimen for
 <i>
  T. vaginalis
 </i>
 infection. The wet mount also should be examined for evidence of BV and candidiasis, especially if vaginal discharge, malodor, or itching is evident.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; A serum sample for immediate evaluation for HIV infection,&nbsp;hepatitis B, and syphilis. Decisions to perform these tests should be made on an individual basis.
</p>
<h4 class="sgc-1" id="sigil_toc_id_397">
 Follow-Up Examinations
</h4>
<p>
 After the initial postassault examination, follow-up examinations&nbsp;provide an opportunity to 1) detect new infections acquired during or after the assault; 2) complete hepatitis B vaccination, if indicated; 3) complete counseling and treatment for other STDs; and 4) monitor side effects and adherence to postexposure prophylactic medication, if prescribed.
</p>
<p>
 Examination for STDs can be repeated within 1&ndash;2 weeks of the assault. Because infectious agents acquired through assault might not have produced sufficient concentrations of organisms to result in positive test results at the initial examination, testing can be repeated during the follow-up visit, unless prophylactic treatment was provided. If treatment was provided, testing should be conducted only if the survivor reports having symptoms. If treatment was not provided, follow-up examination should be conducted within 1 week to ensure that results of positive tests can be discussed promptly with the survivor and that treatment is provided. Serologic tests for syphilis and HIV infection can be repeated 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after the assault if initial test results were negative and infection in the assailant could not be ruled out (see Sexual Assault and STDs, Risk for Acquiring HIV Infection).
</p>
<h3 class="sgc-1" id="sigil_toc_id_398">
 Prophylaxis
</h3>
<p>
 Compliance with follow-up visits is poor among survivors of sexual assault (477,478). As a result, routine preventive therapy after a sexual assault should be encouraged. The following&nbsp;prophylactic regimen is suggested as preventive therapy:
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Postexposure hepatitis B vaccination, without HBIG. This vaccine should be administered to sexual assault survivors at the time of the initial examination if they have not been previously vaccinated. Follow-up doses of vaccine should be administered 1&ndash;2 and 4&ndash;6 months after the first dose.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; An empiric antimicrobial regimen for chlamydia, gonorrhea,&nbsp;and trichomonas.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Emergency contraception. (This measure is necessary only when the assault could result in pregnancy in the survivor.)
</p>
<p>
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 For those requiring alternative treatments, refer to the specific sections in this report relevant to the specific agent. The efficacy of these regimens in preventing infections after sexual assault has not been evaluated. Clinicians should counsel patients regarding the possible benefits and toxicities associated with these treatment regimens; gastrointestinal side effects can occur with this combination.
