 Epididymitis
</h1>
<p>
 Acute epididymitis is a clinical syndrome consisting of pain, swelling, and inflammation of the epididymis that lasts &lt;6 weeks (402). Chronic epididymitis is characterized by a &ge;6 week history of symptoms of discomfort and/or pain in the scrotum, testicle, or epididymis. In most cases of acute epididymitis, the testis is also involved in the process &mdash; a condition referred to as epididymo-orchitis. Chronic epididymitis has been subcategorized into inflammatory chronic epididymitis, obstructive chronic epididymitis, and chronic epididymalgia (403).
</p>
<p>
 Among sexually active men aged &lt;35 years, acute epididymitis is most frequently caused by
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 or
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 . Acute epididymitis caused by sexually transmitted enteric organisms (e.g.,
 <i>
  Escherichia coli
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  Pseudomonas
 </i>
 spp.) also occurs among men who are the insertive partner during anal intercourse. Sexually transmitted acute epididymitis usually is accompanied by urethritis, which frequently is asymptomatic.
</p>
<p>
 In men aged &gt;35 years, sexually transmitted epididymitis is uncommon, whereas bacteriuria secondary to obstructive urinary disease (e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia) is more common. In this older population, nonsexually transmitted epididymitis is associated with urinary tract instrumentation or surgery, systemic disease, and immunosuppression.&nbsp;Chronic infectious epididymitis is most frequently seen in conditions associated with granulomatous reaction;
 <i>
  Mycobacterium tuberculosis
 </i>
 (TB) is the most common granulomatous&nbsp;disease affecting the epididymis. Up to 25% of patients can have bilateral disease, with ultrasound demonstrating&nbsp;an enlarged hyperemic epididymis with multiple cysts and calcifications. Tuberculous epididymitis should be suspected in all patients with a known history of or recent exposure to TB or in patients whose clinical status worsens despite appropriate antibiotic treatment.
