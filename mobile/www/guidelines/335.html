 Other Management Considerations
</h2>
<p>
 The following additional considerations are associated with performing Pap tests:
</p>
<p>
 &bull; The Pap test should not be considered a screening test for STDs.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; All women receiving care in an STD-clinic setting should be considered for cervical cancer screening, regardless of sexual orientation (i.e., heterosexual women and those who identify themselves as lesbian or bisexual).
</p>
<p>
 &bull; If a woman is menstruating, a conventional cytology Pap test should be postponed, and the woman should be advised to have a Pap test at the earliest opportunity.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; If specific infections other than HPV are identified, the patient might need to have a repeat Pap test after appropriate&nbsp;treatment for those infections. However, in most instances (even in the presence of some severe infections), Pap tests will be reported as satisfactory for evaluation, and reliable final reports can be produced without the need to repeat the Pap test after treatment is received.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; When it is necessary to repeat the Pap test because the report was interpreted as unsatisfactory, the repeat test must be determined by the laboratory to be satisfactory and negative before screening can be resumed at regularly scheduled intervals.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; The presence of a mucopurulent discharge should not delay the Pap test. The test can be performed after careful&nbsp;removal of the discharge with a saline-soaked cotton swab.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; In the absence of other indications, women who have external genital warts do not need Pap tests more frequently&nbsp;than women who do not have warts.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; The sequence of Pap testing in relation to collection of other cervicovaginal specimens has not been shown to influence Pap test results or their interpretation (432).
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Women who have had a total hysterectomy do not require a routine Pap test unless the hysterectomy was performed because of cervical cancer or its precursor lesions. As recommended by ACOG, for women with hysterectomy resulting from CIN 2 or higher, cervical or vaginal cuff screening can be discontinued once three normal Pap tests have been documented. In these situations,&nbsp;women should be advised to continue follow-up with the physician(s) who provided health care at the time of the hysterectomy, if possible. In women whose cervix remains intact after a hysterectomy, regularly scheduled Pap tests should be performed as indicated (433&ndash;435).
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Health-care providers who receive basic retraining on Pap-test collection and clinics that use simple quality assurance measures are more likely to obtain satisfactory test results as determined by the laboratory. The use of cytobrushes and brooms also improves the number of satisfactory Pap tests.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Although evidence supports the option of HPV testing for the triage of women with ASC-US Pap test results, this option might not be feasible in an STD clinic because of limited resources.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Liquid-based cytology is an acceptable alternative to conventional Pap tests, as it has similar test-performance characteristics.
