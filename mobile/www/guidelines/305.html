 Management of Sex Partners
</h2>
<p>
 Male sex partners of women with PID should be examined and treated if they had sexual contact with the patient during the 60 days preceding the patient&rsquo;s onset of symptoms. If a patient&rsquo;s last sexual intercourse was &gt;60 days before onset of symptoms or diagnosis, the patient&rsquo;s most recent sex partner should be treated. Patients should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until therapy is completed and until they and their sex partners no longer have symptoms. Evaluation and treatment are imperative because of the risk for reinfection of the patient and the strong likelihood of urethral gonococcal&nbsp;or chlamydial infection in the sex partner. Male partners of women who have PID caused by
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 and/or
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 frequently are asymptomatic.
</p>
<p>
 Sex partners should be treated empirically with regimens effective against both of these infections, regardless of the etiology&nbsp;of PID or pathogens isolated from the infected woman. Even in clinical settings in which only women are treated, arrangements should be made to provide care or appropriate&nbsp;referral for male sex partners of women who have PID (see Partner Management). Expedited partner treatment and enhanced patient referral (see Partner Management) are alternative&nbsp;approaches to treating male partners of women who have chlamydia or gonococcal infections (68,69).
