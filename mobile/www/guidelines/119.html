 Treatment
</h4>
<p>
 CNS involvement can occur during any stage of syphilis. However, CSF laboratory abnormalities are common in persons with early syphilis, even in the absence of clinical neurological findings. No evidence exists to support variation from recommended treatment for early syphilis for patients found to have such abnormalities. If clinical evidence of neurologic involvement is observed (e.g., cognitive dysfunction, motor or sensory deficits, ophthalmic or auditory symptoms, cranial nerve palsies, and symptoms or signs of meningitis), a CSF examination should be performed.
</p>
<p>
 Syphilitic uveitis or other ocular manifestations frequently are associated with neurosyphilis and should be managed according to the treatment recommendations for neurosyphilis. Patients who have neurosyphilis or syphilitic eye disease (e.g.,&nbsp;uveitis, neuroretinitis, and optic neuritis) should be treated with the recommended regimen for neurosyphilis; those with eye disease should be managed in collaboration with an ophthalmologist. A CSF examination should be performed for all patients with syphilitic eye disease to identify those with abnormalities; patients found to have abnormal CSF test results should be provided follow-up CSF examinations to assess treatment response.

            <div id="regimen_header">Recommended Regimen
            </div>
            <hr/>
            <span class="regimen_text">Aqueous crystalline penicillin G 18–24 million units per day, administered as 3–4 million units IV every 4 hours or continuous infusion, for 10–14 days
            </span>

        </div>

<p>
 If compliance with therapy can be ensured, the following alternative regimen might be considered.
</p>
<p>

        <div id="table">
            <div id="regimen_header">Alternative Regimen
            </div>
            <hr/>
            <span class="regimen_text">Procaine penicillin 2.4 million units IM once daily
            <div id="or">PLUS</div>Probenecid 500 mg orally four times a day, both for 10–14 days
            </span>

        </div>
 <br/>
</p>
<p>
 The durations of the recommended and alternative regimens for neurosyphilis are shorter than the duration of the regimen used for late syphilis in the absence of neurosyphilis. Therefore, benzathine penicillin, 2.4 million units IM once per week for up to 3 weeks, can be considered after completion of these neurosyphilis treatment regimens to provide a comparable total duration of therapy.
