<p>
 Two HPV vaccines are licensed in the United States: a bivalent vaccine (Cervarix) containing HPV types 16 and 18 and a quadrivalent vaccine (Gardasil) vaccine containing HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. Both vaccines offer protection against the HPV types that cause 70% of cervical cancers (i.e., types 16 and 18), and the quadrivalent HPV vaccine also protects against the types that cause 90% of genital warts (i.e., types 6 and 11). Either vaccine can be administered to girls aged 11&ndash;12 years and can be administered to those as young as 9 years of age (15,16); girls and women ages 13&ndash;26 years who have not started or completed the vaccine series also should receive the vaccine. HPV vaccine is indicated for girls in this&nbsp;age group, because benefit is greatest if it is administered before the onset of sexual activity. The quadrivalent (Gardasil) HPV vaccine can also be used in males aged 9&ndash;26 years to prevent genital warts (17). Administering the vaccine to boys before the onset of sexual activity is optimal. Both HPV vaccines are administered as a 3-dose series of IM injections over a 6-month period, with the second and third doses given 1&ndash;2 and then 6 months after the first dose. Ideally, the same vaccine product should be used for the entire 3-dose series. HPV vaccine is available for eligible children and adolescents aged &lt;19 years through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program (available by calling CDC INFO [800-232-4636]).
</p>
<p>
 Women who have received HPV vaccine should continue routine cervical cancer screening because 30% of cervical cancers are caused by HPV types other than 16 or 18. In the United States, the vaccines are not licensed or recommended for use in women &gt;26 years of age. No published data are available on the effectiveness, programmatic requirements, or cost-effectiveness of administering the HPV vaccine in STD clinic settings.
