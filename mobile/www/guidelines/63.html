 Suppressive Therapy for Recurrent Genital Herpes
</h4>
<p>
 Suppressive therapy reduces the frequency of genital herpes recurrences by 70%&ndash;80% in patients who have frequent recurrences (166&ndash;169); many persons receiving such therapy report having experienced no symptomatic outbreaks.Treatment also is effective in patients with less frequent recurrences. Safety and efficacy have been documented among patients receiving daily therapy with acyclovir for as long as 6 years and with valacyclovir or famciclovir for 1 year (171,172). Quality of life is improved in many patients with frequent recurrences who receive suppressive therapy rather than episodic treatment.
</p>
<p>
 The frequency of recurrent genital herpes outbreaks diminishes over time in many patients, and the patient&rsquo;s psychological adjustment to the disease might change. Therefore, periodically during suppressive treatment (e.g., once a year), providers should discuss the need to continue therapy with the patient.
</p>
<p>
 Treatment with valacyclovir 500 mg daily decreases the rate of HSV-2 transmission in discordant, heterosexual couples in which the source partner has a history of genital HSV-2 infection (170). Such couples should be encouraged to consider suppressive antiviral therapy as part of a strategy to prevent transmission, in addition to consistent condom use and avoidance of sexual activity during recurrences. Suppressive antiviral therapy also is likely to reduce transmission when used by persons who have multiple partners (including MSM) and by those who are HSV-2 seropositive without a history of genital herpes.
</p>
<p>
 Acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir appear equally effective for episodic treatment of genital herpes, but famciclovir appears somewhat less effective for suppression of viral shedding (163&ndash;167,173). Ease of administration and cost also are important considerations for prolonged treatment.
